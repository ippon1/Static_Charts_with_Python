    <h2>Evaluating the Austrian NR elections using the First-Past-The-Post</h2>
    <p>
        With the US election coming up this November, we were interested to see how the election results and the
        distribution of members in the lower house of the parliament and the Government of Austria could look like if we
        used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality_voting">first-past-the-post</a> electoral system.
        This election system was uWe wanted to see if the structure of the results would be similar that of the the USA.
    </p>
    <p>
        We took a special look at some of the most popular points of <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting#Criticisms">critique</a> and tried to find
        out if these points would hold true for Austria as well.
        For this, we mainly focus on the maps of the districts and electoral district levels.
        The map of municipalities is manly for references and providing a closer look on the results.
    </p>

    <h2>About the visualizations</h2>
    <h3>Parallel Coordinates</h3>
    <p>
        "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality_voting">First-past-the-post</a>" shows the percentage of
        regions (municipality/district/electoral district) where a certain party won (each line represents a party).
        "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation">Proportional Representation</a>" shows the
        percentage of seats in the National Council won by the parties. So how the National Council actually look like.
    </p>
    <h3>Choropleth Map</h3>
    <p>
        Provides geographical context for the data and details-on-demand on hover and click.
    </p>
    <h3>Bar Charts</h3>
    <p>
        The bar charts on the right-hand side show, in numbers, equivalent data to that shown by the parallel
        coordinates.
        "First Past The Post" shows the number of regions where a certain party won in the selected year.
        "Proportional Representation" shows the number of sets in the National Council won by the parties in the
        selected year.
    </p>
    <p>
        The bar charts that arise on a hover interaction on the choropleh map show the number of votes for each party in
        the hovered region.
    </p>

    <h2>Interesting findings</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Fairness</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Largest parties receive an "unfair" "seat bonus": In the <a href="#">2019</a> election, the ÖVP won at
                least 80 percent of the seats compared to about 37,46 percent of the total cast votes.
            </li>
            <li>Smaller parties are disadvantaged: On the district and voting district level the NEOS, BZÖ, JETZT, FRANK
                did not get a single seat in any of the elections analysed.
            </li>
            <li>For smaller parties, it is more important to focus on a few areas instead of spreading their resources
                across the whole country: does not apply as we do not have local parties. But if Austria would use this
                system in <a href="#">2013</a> the NEOS and the BZÖ might have focused on the birth region of their
                respective leaders. In this regions they won some municipalities but did not get enough votes to win a
                whole districts.
            </li>
            <li>Parties with similar political orientation hurt each other much more than with the Proportional
                Representation: In the <a href="#">2013</a> election, the BZÖ and the FPÖ (both right-wing parties)
                would have been able to win more districts if they would have worked together.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Coalitions are less likely: In all but one (<a href="#">Districts + 2013</a>) configuration of the nine
            possible examples, a coalition was necessary to have a majority.
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state">View swing seats</a> change election results (and many
            "safe seats" for large parties): In the last three elections, there were many states where not only one
            party won. With the analysis of more elections, we suspect there could be a trend.
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering">Gerrymandering</a>: Unrelated but we kind of did this
            after WWI (<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trennungsgesetz">Trennungsgesetz</a>)
        </li>
    </ul>
