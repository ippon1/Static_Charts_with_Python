# Visualize the results of the national election 2019 in Austria.
We will analyze and visualize the results of the national election 2019 in Austria.
This project was created for the Course [Informationsvisualisierung](https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/courses/InfoVis/ue.html) at [TU Wien](https://www.tuwien.at).

## Using the First-past-the-post voting system for Austrian Elections

### TODOs
* Add Wahlkarten
* Make graphics more user mobile-friendly
* Compare more years
* Compare Austrian presidential elections to US presidential elections
* Check how many votes the winning party could lose and still govern alone (50% + 1) and/or change the constitution on their own (66,67%).
* Bar plot: make extra bars for each small party
* Sum Up similar Parties (LEFT vs RIGHT)
* make transitions for pie chart
* link graphics in text
* Add slider to pie chart
* Change to Bootstrap
* Make header sticky
* Check if all values are correct

## Data Cleaning & Interactive Bokeh Charts
Visualization [here](https://ippon1.github.io/Visualize_of_Austrian_Election_Results/Data_Cleaning)


The goal of the third exercise is to learn some advanced data manipulation techniques with Pandas, simple machine learning using sci-kit learn, and interactive plots for Python using Bokeh.

The exercise is split into two tasks:

* Loading and transforming the data using Pandas, performing a PCA so that we can visualize the similarities between counties ("Gemeinden").
* Visualizing the counties as a biplot, where x and y are the first two principal components, and the projected axes should show the influence of the parties. The following properties should be visualized:
  * The size of the dot should represent the number of votes (i.e., the more votes, the larger the dots).
  * The color of the dot should be given according to its state (i.e., all counties of a state should have the same color).
  * Upon hover, the name, state (Bundesland), and number of votes should be revealed as a tooltip.
  * The parties should be represented as "projected axes".

  Useful Bokeh Tutorials:
  * [Colored scatterplot](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/gallery/color_scatter.html)
  * [Plotting with basic glyphs](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/plotting.html)
  * [Adding annotations, like arrows and text labels](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/annotations.html)

  Use pandas to load the file 'NRW19.csv'. This file was downloaded from [BMI](https://www.bmi.gv.at/412/Nationalratswahlen/Nationalratswahl_2019/) as xlsx File, and was slightly modified so that it can be loaded with Pandas as csv file.

  Be aware: the csv file still contains German number formatting so that Pandas does not read and convert the numbers properly. Provide the correct parameters for [separators, decimals, and thousands](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html) so that Pandas parses the number values correctly.



## Linked Views with d3

The goal of the second exercise is to create multiple coordinated views on web pages, where users can interactively explore the data.

In the second exercise, we will create a simple web page, where a map of Austria and a pie chart of the election results are shown. After loading the data from the provided CSV file, the exercise is split into the following tasks:

* Fill the states in the map with the color of the party that reached the majority in this state. The colors are provided in data.js.
* Compute the percentages of votes for entire Austria and show as pie chart. Use the svg_pie container for the pie chart.
* Link the two charts. There are two possible options. If both options are implemented, 10 extra points can be scored:
 * By hovering over a state in the map, show the pie chart of the respective state, as well as the name of the selected state in the paragraph with ID state.
* By hovering over a segment in the pie chart, show a choropleth map of the votes of the selected party for all states. This can be achieved by changing the opacity of the respective state depending on the percentage.

Standard view: maximum results and pie chart for Austria:

    d3 exercise: Austria view
    Linking pie chart --> map (selection = ÖVP):
    Linking pie chart --> map
    Linking map --> pie chart (selection = Lower Austria):
    Linking map --> pie chart

There are many online d3 tutorials. Here is a small selection:
* Tutorials directly on d3 Github
* Tutorialspoint
* d3 wiki
* d3.v4 Tutorial by Square

There are numerous d3 implementations of standard charts out there. You can look at those existing implementations and adapt them to your needs, for example:

* https://observablehq.com/@d3/pie-chart
* How to render GeoJSON using d3
* US choropleth map

Mind that we are using d3.v5, which is no longer compatible to the more wide-spread d3.v3 used for many online examples!

### TODOs
* Keep the same order of parties (my idea)

## Static Charts with Python
Visualization [here](https://ippon1.github.io/Visualize_of_Austrian_Election_Results/Static_Charts_with_Python)

The goal of this exercise is to get into some first contact with Python, Pandas data frames, and the many opportunities how to quickly generate static charts from data frames.

For the first exercise, show the results of the election per state (Bundesland) and party using two simple charts of your choice. The data is provided as a CSV file with the states as rows and the parties (in percentages) as columns. Describe in a few sentences what can be seen in your visualizations. Visualization techniques could be (but are not limited to):

* Parallel coordinates with parties or states (Bundesländer) as axes
* Grouped bar charts, grouped by parties or states
* Pie charts for each state
* Radviz of states: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.plotting.radviz.html
* Scatterplot matrix showing the party share over the states or the percentage in the states for the parties
* Principal components of the states (using PCA) in a 2D scatterplot

### Implementation hints

Load the data using pandas and show the table in the notebook:

    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.read_csv("NRW2019_Bundeslaender.csv")
    df

Depending on your chosen visualization, you might want to use the Austrian official party colors. Depending on the chosen visualization library, you will need to use the Matplotlib colormap (cm) or the color list (colors).

    from matplotlib.colors import LinearSegmentedColormap


    colors = ['#63C3D0', '#ce000c', '#0056A2', '#E3257B', '#ADADAD', '#88B626', '#333333']
    cm = LinearSegmentedColormap.from_list('austrianParties', colors, N=7)
